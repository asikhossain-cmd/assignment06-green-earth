01. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Ans: var is global scope but let and const is block scope also functional scope, that means we can not access let and const variable outside or the scope if we already set it as a block scope 
and if we something se as const then we cannot re assign it but let can allow reassign 
and var has also some security bug but let and const does not.
